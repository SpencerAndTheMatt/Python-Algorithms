# Python-Programmes
Various Python Programmes I've written over time. Includes non-linear curve fitting.
Recently started learning TensorFlow, so there will be some of those in here too.
Any python games will be added to seperate repositories, to distinguish them from python algorithms.
Hoping to add some database projects to this repository.
